# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This is a compiling of notes on HTML, CSS, git, and JavaScript. Due to the rapid pace of the course and high volume of information being taught, I found it helpful to gather everything in one place. The clearly distinguished sections make organization much easier than with an old-fashioned pen and paper, and the web deployment makes it accessible to me anywhere I go. This process taught me the building blocks of web development.

## Usage

This study guide was designed to be very easy to use. The information is organized by topic, and each topic is clearly distinguishable from the rest. Also, after opening the DevTools console, we can see Javascript running. It contains a list of topics we learned from the prework, and will randomly choose a topic to study firest.
